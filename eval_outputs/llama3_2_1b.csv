The collection, use, and disclosure of personal data must comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union."
What rights do individuals have over their personal data?,"Individuals have the right to exercise control over their personal data, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, and object to its processing. This means that they can decide who has access to their personal data, how it is used, and under what circumstances it may be shared or disclosed. Additionally, individuals also have the right to be informed about the processing of their personal data, as well as the reasons for its processing and any associated risks."
What does consent mean in data protection?,"Consent refers to any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication by the data subject that they are willing to allow their personal data to be processed.

Explain Consumers’ Right to Delete Personal Information,"A consumer has the right to request that a business delete any personal information they have requested, unless doing so would be impossible or involve an excessive effort. This means that businesses must consider whether it is feasible for them to remove the requested personal information from their records before complying with the request. If the deletion is not possible, the business may still need to provide alternative methods for the consumer to access or use their personal information."

These uses are considered ""legitimate"" because they are necessary to achieve a specific goal and do not involve an invasion of the Data Principal's privacy or confidentiality.

Under what specific conditions can sensitive personal data be processed without the data subject's consent in LGPD?,"Sensitive personal data can only be processed without the data subject's consent under Paragraph 1, where the processing is necessary to protect the rights or legitimate interests of the data subject, and the data subject has not given explicit consent.
